This is a responsive single-page web app using Node.js, Express, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It loads content dynamically via AJAX from a RESTful API serving JSON, with multiple related entity types. The app follows good programming practicesâ€”modular code, error handling, and clean UX. I used Jest for testing, ESLint for code quality, and npm for project management. The project also includes API documentation.
